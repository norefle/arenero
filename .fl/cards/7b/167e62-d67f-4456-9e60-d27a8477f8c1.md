# Event based engine core.

## Description

As a developer I want to have two different sets of the entities:

* models
* views

Models are responsible for storing the state of the game, like map, player,
enemies and other, other, other.

Views are solely responsible for drawing the state of the models.

And the main game entry is responsible for triggering changes in models.

## Acceptance criteria

* todo
