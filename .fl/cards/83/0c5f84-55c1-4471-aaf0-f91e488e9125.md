# Core: create and use keymanager.

## Description

As a player I want to have possibility to bind different keys for
different actions and persist them between game sessions.

As a developer I want to have convenient way to get configured key binding
and translate/compare it to the actual key codes.

## Acceptance criteria

* There is key manager.
* Key manager provides the way to set key (keys?) for the defined action.
* Key manager provides the way to translate key (keys) to the action.
* [Optional] key manager uses persistence storage to save/load keybindings.
