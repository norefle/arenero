# Add main screen for Arenero.

## Description

The main screen should represent list of available modules:

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

<< [ A ] [ B ] [ C ] >>

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Where every module provides thumbnail image for preview
(a, b, c in example).

### Listing existed modules

Arenero iterates over all modules in _module_ catalog and
opens them:

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
local module = require "module.name"

```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Every module should export the following fields:

* name - the short name of the module.
* description - detailed description of the module.
* thumbnail - path to the thumbnail image (should be in module/name/asset/).

### Mandatory methods:

Every module should export the following methods:

* init
* draw 

## Acceptance criteria

* All described above functionality is implemented.
* I could select one of the initial modules "Picker" or "Grid" and start
  seeing its work on screen.
