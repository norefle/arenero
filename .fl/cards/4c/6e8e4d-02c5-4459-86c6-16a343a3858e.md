# Add module for tiled map rendering.

## Description

As a dev I want to have possibility to play with tiled map
rendering based on provided data.

The map should be described as an array with the tile objects
from top left corner to the bottom right.

Every tile object has its own:

* type (0 - water, 1 - sand, 2 - grass)

As a user I want to have possibility to interact with the map:

* rotate it
* move it
* zoom it

### Optional

As a user I want to have possibility to see the map in minimap window.

## Acceptance criteria

* The following array:
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
  0, 1, 2, 1, 0,
  0, 2, 0, 2, 0,
  0, 1, 2, 1, 0,
  0, 0, 1, 0, 0,
  0, 0, 0, 0, 0

  should render island in the ocean. :)

* All described controls should also be implemented
  (rotation, moving, zooming).
